# Learn-Power-Query
This repo is to capture all learning of Power Query from the online course "Excel Power Query Beginner to Advanced (including M)" by Leila Gharani in Udemy

## Import data by Power Query:
- My current Excel does not have Load To option to Pivot Table, thus I have to use the below steps to not import the whole table from the resources to the report file.
  - In Load To window, select Create Connection. Also select to add the data to Data Model so that it can later be used with Pivot tabl.

  - After loading the data to Excel, select Power Pivot and check if the data is in the Data Model
  - Once data is in Data Model, it can be used for the Pivot Table.
